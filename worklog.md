Task ID: 3
Agent: main
Task: Re-enable GraphQL API with full schema, resolvers, and endpoint

Work Log:
- Installed GraphQL packages: graphql@16.13.2, graphql-yoga@5.21.0, @graphql-tools/schema@10.0.32
- Wrote comprehensive GraphQL typeDefs (58 types) in src/lib/graphql/schema.ts covering:
  - Platform stats, billing data, tenants, users, audit logs queries
  - Role-based dashboard queries: admin, teacher, student, parent, tenant detail
  - Mutations: createTenant, updateTenant, deleteTenant, toggleTenantStatus
  - Input types: TenantInput, TenantUpdateInput
- Wired up GraphQL endpoint using graphql-yoga in src/app/api/graphql/route.ts
  - Supports both GET (GraphiQL IDE) and POST (queries/mutations)
  - CORS enabled, full error display for development
- Used native graphql `buildSchema` + direct resolver attachment (bypasses @graphql-tools strict validation issues)
- Resolvers from resolvers.ts (all 9 queries + 4 mutations) fully functional
- Client-side hooks (hooks.ts) already use direct fetch to /api/graphql with TanStack Query caching
- Updated apollo-client.ts (Apollo not needed — hooks use direct fetch)
- Verified all queries return real data from seeded database
- ESLint passes clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)

Stage Summary:
- GraphQL endpoint fully operational at /api/graphql
- 9 queries: platformStats, billingData, tenants, users, auditLogs, adminDashboard, teacherDashboard, studentDashboard, parentDashboard, tenantDetail
- 4 mutations: createTenant, updateTenant, deleteTenant, toggleTenantStatus
- GraphiQL IDE available in browser for interactive query testing
- All frontend hooks ready to consume GraphQL data
